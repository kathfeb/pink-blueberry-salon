  email: yup.string().email().required(),
  name: yup.string().min(2).required(),
  phone: yup.string().matches(/phoneRegex/).required(),
  // ... other fields
});

// React Hook Form Integration
const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors }, trigger } = useForm({
  resolver: yupResolver(schema),
  mode: 'onBlur'
});

// Step Validation
const handleNextStep = async () => {
  const isValid = await trigger(fieldsForCurrentStep);
  if (isValid) setStep(step + 1);
};
```

## 📝 User Experience Flow

1. **Add to Cart** → Product added with feedback
2. **View Cart** → Drawer slides out with cart items
3. **Proceed to Checkout** → Checkout modal opens
4. **Fill Shipping Info** → Real-time validation
5. **Enter Payment** → Card formatting, test mode notice
6. **Review Order** → Complete summary
7. **Place Order** → Processing animation
8. **Checkout Closes** → Modal disappears
9. **Success Modal** → Confirmation appears separately
10. **Auto Close** → Returns to shopping after 5 seconds

## 🐛 Testing the Checkout
