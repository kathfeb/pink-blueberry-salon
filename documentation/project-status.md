### Key Design Decisions
1. **Simple Component Structure**: Avoided over-fragmentation by keeping related components together
2. **Feature-Based Organization**: Components grouped by feature rather than atomic design
3. **Direct Redux Integration**: Used Redux Toolkit for simple state management
4. **Tailwind Utilities**: Leveraged Tailwind classes with custom component styles
5. **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
